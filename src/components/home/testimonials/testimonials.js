    text: "ANC's sessions have helped me discover a passion for flying and flight simulators I didn't know I had. Starting from scratch, they taught me how to operate an aircraft using proper procedures. Professional teaching and constant feedback from their amazing and friendly instructors in group and one-on-one sessions, have taught me how to avoid the pitfalls of uneducated simulator flying, and gave me a much steeper learning curve than I could have hoped for. I’m grateful for everything I learned here when I go to a real flight school.",

Illustrates concepts and principles with stories and demonstrations which really brings some of the more abstract aviation concepts to life. Does all this in a highly professional yet personable manner. Really easy going but manages to maintain the focus of the lesson plan without making anything seem rushed or hurried. Obviously understands how to help students learn.",
