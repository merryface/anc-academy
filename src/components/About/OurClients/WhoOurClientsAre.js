      summary: "Flight training can be expensive, and quite often people go through that training on a budget. With prices between £200 and £500 an hour for flight training, repeat lessons and delays can all be costly. For a tenth of those prices, we can help our clients consolidate skills and perfect their understanding of complex subject matters, so that they don’t have to risk repeating expensive lessons or retaking costly examinations.",
